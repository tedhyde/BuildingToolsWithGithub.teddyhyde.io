      <div class="sect1">
<h2 id="appendix_b">Appendix A: GitHub Enterprise</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people understandably equate GitHub (the company) with GitHub.com (the website), but it&#8217;s interesting to note that they&#8217;re not one and the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub website, as important as it is to modern open and closed source software development, is not the only product that GitHub (the company) produces.
The single largest other product from that team is called GitHub Enterprise, and it&#8217;s a version of the GitHub software that can be deployed inside a corporate firewall&#x2014;like having your own private GitHub.com.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two products are very similar from a user&#8217;s point of view, but there are some important differences.
It can sometimes be hard to imagine the kinds of difficulties that Enterprise is designed to solve, but keep in mind that it&#8217;s for large teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using GitHub Enterprise isn&#8217;t as easy as signing up for an account.
You&#8217;re responsible for all the infrastructure and maintenance, including installation, updates, system maintenance, keeping the machine running, and so on.
However, if your company is considering Enterprise, it&#8217;s likely you already have specialists who are already doing this for other services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub team has also made it pretty easy for them.
The software comes as a pre-packaged virtual machine in a variety of formats, so you&#8217;ll likely find something that fits into your infrastructure.
Once the machine is running, most of the configuration can be done with a web interface, but there are some tricky bits like network configuration and port forwarding that aren&#8217;t easy for the layperson to get right.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="administration">Administration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since you&#8217;re in control of the environment in which Enterprise runs, you now have a lot of concerns that the typical GitHub.com user does not.
GitHub Enterprise has an administration interface for dealing with these issues, which doesn&#8217;t exist on GitHub.com.
It allows management of things like system resources, reports, search, and many others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, while GitHub.com has its own user system, GitHub Enterprise can optionally plug in to your organization&#8217;s existing authentication system.
This allows a company&#8217;s IT organization to manage user identities in one single place, rather than having to duplicate a lot of effort when a new team member hires on.
It also eases the initial transition, when perhaps thousands of people will need new accounts.
Several systems are supported, including LDAP and SAML, as well as plain old email and password.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="endpoints">Endpoints</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The complete GitHub API is also available on an Enterprise instance;
you just need to send your requests to <a href="https://&lt;hostname&gt;/api/v3" class="bare">https://&lt;hostname&gt;/api/v3</a>
instead of <a href="https://api.github.com/" class="bare">https://api.github.com/</a>. You can imagine that some users
have accounts on both an Enterprise instance as well as GitHub.com,
and many applications have started supporting this scenario.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="full-hostnames-versus-mount-points">Full Hostnames Versus Mount Points</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the main differences between GitHub.com and an Enterprise setup
is often in the way that hostnames are set up. GitHub.com has several
hostnames for various content served. An incomplete list includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>github.io</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Hosting Jekyll blogs for users and project pages</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>gist.github.com</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Hosting gists</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>raw.githubusercontent.com</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Hosting raw pages (unprocessed files)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a variety of reasons, Enterprise GitHub installations often don&#8217;t
retain the same mapping. An Enterprise installation might look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>github.bigdevcorp.example.com/pages/xrd/somerepo</em></dt>
<dd>
<p> Hosting gh-pages sites
<em>github.bigdevcorp.example.com/gists</em>:
 Hosting gists</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, Enterprise installations often map the subdomains to a
subdirectory rather than a different hostname. This simplifies the setup
of the Enterprise installation. But it means that some tools require
reconfiguration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the command-line <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/gist">Gist tool</a>, you need to export an environment
variable that specifies the Gist URL:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ export GITHUB_URL=http://github.bigdevcorp.example.com/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the command-line <a href="https://github.com/github/hub">Hub tool</a>, you need to use a different
variable&#x2014;<code>GITHUB_HOST</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ GITHUB_HOST=github.bigdevcorp.example.com hub clone myproject</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="command-line-client-tools-curl">Command-Line Client Tools: cURL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We show in <a href="#introduction">[introduction]</a> how to use cURL to make a request against
the API on the main GitHub.com site. If you wanted to do this against
an Enterprise site, your request would look a little different:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ curl -i https://github.bigdevcorp.example.com/api/v3/search/repositories?q=@ben</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="example-request-using-a-client-library">Example Request Using a Client Library</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use a client library, most provide a way
to configure the library to use a different endpoint, as is required
when you are using an Enterprise GitHub instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book documents connecting to GitHub using five different
languages: Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Python, and C#. Here are examples in
each language. With these snippets in hand, any example in the book
can be converted to work against a GitHub Enterprise server.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ruby-client-configuration">Ruby Client Configuration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the Octokit Ruby library, use code like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">github = Github.new
           basic_auth: 'login:password',
           endpoint: 'https://github.bigdevcorp.example.com/api/v3/'
puts github.repos.list</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="java">Java</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the EGit Java library, this code specifies an Enterprise endpoint:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">GitHubClient client = new GitHubClient("github.bigcorpdev.example.com");
UserService us = new UserService(client);
us.getUser("internaluser");</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you create a new GitHub-backed service object of any type, you
parameterize the service constructor with the customized client
object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, note that this library is specifically configured for version 3 (v3) of the
API (you cannot specify another version). If you need to use a newer
version of the API, you will need to make sure you are using the
correct version of the EGit libraries. And, unfortunately, there is no
way to use an older version of the API with this Java client if you
have an outdated Enterprise server that for some reason cannot be
upgraded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaScript library we write about in this book (GitHub.js) uses the
following syntax to specify a GitHub Enterprise backend:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var github = new Github({
  apiUrl: "https://github.bigdevcorp.example.com/api/v3"
  ...
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="python">Python</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agithub client we use in <a href="#python_search_api">[python_search_api]</a> does not permit
parameterizing an Enterprise endpoint when creating the GitHub
client. To use an Enterprise endpoint you need to define a new class
that overrides the built-in <code>agithub.Github</code> and then use that new
client in place of the built-in one:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py">class GitHubEnterprise(agithub.API):
    def __init__(self, api_url, *args, **kwargs):
        props = ConnectionProperties(
                    api_url = api_url,
                    secure_http = True,
                    extra_headers = {
                        'accept' :    'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
                        }
                    )

        self.setClient(Client(*args, **kwargs))
        self.setConnectionProperties(props)

g = GitHubEnterprise('github.mycorp.com', 'myusername', 'mypassword')</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="c">C#</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default behavior of the Octokit library is to connect to
GitHub.com, but it&#8217;s relatively straightforward to give it another API
host instead. Simply replace the instantiation of the <code>GitHubClient</code>
object with something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">var ghe = new Uri("https://github.myenterprise.com/");
var client = new GitHubClient(new ProductHeaderValue("my-cool-app"), ghe);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="management-api">Management API</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enterprise servers have a special additional API section that isn&#8217;t
available on GitHub.com, called the Management Console API. It allows
you to do things like check settings, maintain SSH keys, manage your
license, and so on. Nearly anything you can do from the web management
console, you can do through the API (so you can script management
tasks when desirable).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentation for the Enterprise API is available at <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/enterprise" class="bare">https://developer.github.com/v3/enterprise</a>.</p>
