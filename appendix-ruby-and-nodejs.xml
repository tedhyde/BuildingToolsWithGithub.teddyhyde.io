<appendix xml:id="appendix">
<title>Ruby, NodeJS, (and the Shell) at GitHub</title>
<simpara>The founders of GitHub all had deep ties and contributions to the Ruby
programming language, so we cover it more than other languages in this
book.</simpara>
<simpara>In recent years, NodeJS (JavaScript for the server side) has
grown in popularity, and JavaScript has always been an interesting
language because it works on both the client side and server
side. GitHub has offered several popular open source projects written
in NodeJS.</simpara>
<simpara>For these reasons, this appendix gives a little more detail
on using these two languages.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition, some fluency with the shell is beneficial. There are many
GUI programs that hide the command line from you, but to truly dive
deep into the GitHub API, it is worthwhile to use the command line
inside a shell. These examples all work with bash (the Bourne Again
Shell), but are careful not to use any advanced features of bash (so
they should convert to other shells if you strongly favor another
shell).</simpara>

</indexterm>When the history of GitHub is documented, the Ruby language will
take its place as a major character. Tom Preston Warner (one of the three
founders of GitHub) built the initial libraries for using Git with

<indexterm>
<primary>origins of</primary>
</indexterm>Ruby, a library called Grit. You can host blogs on GitHub for free,
and this tool called Jekyll is built using Ruby. Gollum, the
technology that powers GitHub wikis, is built using Grit and runs on Ruby.</simpara>
<simpara>To understand GitHub, it is best to understand a little bit of Ruby.
You can use many of the tools used at GitHub by simply installing Ruby,
and not knowing any Ruby syntax. This book will not require you to
become an expert in Ruby, but will ask you to read through Ruby
code. We write in a literal, readable way, so that anyone with basic
software developer skills and mastery of the English language should
be able to understand the tools we are using. Ruby is not a perfect
language, but is a useful addition to a developer&#8217;s toolkit because of
its focus on developer productivity.</simpara>

<title>Installing Ruby</title>

<indexterm>
<primary>installation</primary>
</indexterm>There are many ways to get Ruby but not all of them are created equal.
As a long-time user I have experienced the pain of using a preinstalled Ruby
or one from a package manager, and generally these installation
methods provide a suboptimal experience. If you are not familiar with
Ruby, use this appendix to get through installation with the least
friction and trouble.</simpara>
<simpara>You might already have a version of Ruby installed. Mac OS X comes
bundled with Ruby and various flavors of Linux do as well (or provide
a quick and easy installation through the built-in package manager
like "apt-get"). However, I recommend that you use the method of
installation described here rather than using the stock installed
version of Ruby you might already have on your system. Often Ruby
packages require a specific version of Ruby, though they may work with other versions. The problem is that you
might encounter subtle bugs that have never been seen before, and using
the methods described here will make it trivial to install any version
of Ruby that you need side by side with any other version. You can
guarantee you are using the correct version, and the method described
here will not interfere with any other previously installed version of
Ruby you already have on your system.</simpara>
<simpara>To install Ruby, use RVM. RVM <indexterm>
<primary>RVM (Ruby Version Manager)</primary>
</indexterm>stands for Ruby Version Manager. RVM allows you to install
multiple versions of Ruby on your machine and have them interoperate
without conflict. You will probably only need to install a single
version of Ruby to use the examples in the book. And RVM makes it so
that if you choose to install another version, you will not have to
reconfigure any applications that relied on the other versions
installed.</simpara>
<simpara>Installation of Ruby using RVM depends on your operating system. If
you are using Mac OS X or Linux, your installation will probably be as
simple as running these commands from a shell:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable</programlisting>
<simpara>This will install RVM and Ruby.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are running Windows, you can use RVM to install Ruby, but your
instructions are a little more complicated. Refer to the documentation
to do so. A better option is to consider installing something<indexterm>
<primary>VirtualBox</primary>
</indexterm> like
VirtualBox (a virtual machine manager). If you do this, you can
install RVM inside a Linux Virtual Machine (VM). Windows is, sadly, a
second-class citizen with Ruby and RVM and, for this reason, it is
often better to install RVM inside a host system like Linux, which has
a wider community around it to support you. VirtualBox and Linux are
free as in beer and as in speech, so you can try them out without cost
(other than your time). There are many native gems for Ruby that
don&#8217;t properly compile if the host system is Windows, so you can save
yourself considerable time by just using a completely free (as in
beer) option like VirtualBox and a Linux virtual machine running on
Windows instead of fighting with running everything directly on Windows.</simpara>

</indexterm><indexterm>
<primary>Gemfile</primary>
</indexterm>Gemfile</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Ruby packages libraries in a format called a gem. A
gemfile is a manifest that describes which gems your application
needs. Gemfiles make it simple to install all the required
libraries: run the <literal>bundle</literal> command from a shell prompt and all
libraries will be installed, which can include downloading from the
network and building from source if compilation is required.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><emphasis>.ruby-version</emphasis> or <emphasis>.rvmrc</emphasis></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>These two files tell your application
(or shell) which version of Ruby to use. Often applications will
include this file as a part of their package. If you use RVM, it
will either switch to that version of Ruby or prompt you to install
that version. Imagine that you have an
application that only runs on Ruby 2.1.3. You can create a file
called <emphasis>.ruby-version</emphasis>, which contains the string <literal>ruby-2.1.3</literal> and
when your application starts, it will automatically use that version
of Ruby. There are other Ruby-based tools (like the
zero-configuration web server Pow) that are aware of files
like <emphasis>.ruby-version</emphasis> and will properly use the correct version of Ruby if
they see this file.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><emphasis>config.ru</emphasis></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>This is a file used to run Ruby applications using
Rack. Rack is a web server interface, compatible with many
application servers. If you see a <emphasis>config.ru</emphasis> file, you can run this
application with many different servers. These can be powerful frontends used in production on many large sites on the Internet, or they
can be minimal servers used just on a single laptop; Rack makes it
easy to set up a server.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>If you are running Mac OS X, you need to
install Xcode and the command-line tools. If you are a software
developer, you probably have these already installed. If not, review
online documentation to install these. If you are running Linux, you
might not have installed the compiler chain; you can install all the
build tools you will ever need using this command: <literal>sudo apt-get
install build-essential</literal>. This can take a while, but will ensure you
have all the tools necessary for building RVM and any binary gems.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Missing developer libraries</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>There are some libraries that support
Ruby (readline support, as an example, which allows you to use
command-line history inside of an interactive Ruby shell) that are
not always installed or available to the RVM tool. RVM has greatly
improved in detecting the correct libraries, and there are often
notes that tell you how to properly configure these libraries. Make
sure to read the output printed to the screen as you install Ruby
using RVM for special instructions specific to your platform.<indexterm>

</indexterm>NodeJS is the server-side version of JavaScript. JavaScript is the
only ubiquitious client-side programming language for the Web. Between
Ruby and JavaScript, you can build any web application you
need. Tools like Hubot show the benefits of using a language like
JavaScript running on the NodeJS platform, which facilitates building

<primary>NVM (Node version manager)</primary>
</indexterm>NVM stands for "Node Version Manager" and is a direct correlate
to RVM. Like RVM, NVM allows you to install multiple versions of
NodeJS on a single machine and switch between them seamlessly. This
can be very useful when using a tool like NodeJS that is iterating
rapidly (and whose modules are also often tested against only a very
new version of NodeJS). NVM runs on OS X or Linux. To install, run
these commands from a shell prompt:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ curl -o- \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.3/install.sh | \
bash</programlisting>
<simpara>This will install NVM for you. You then might need to run <literal>source
~/.bash_profile</literal> to load the NVM scripts. Once this is completed, you
are able to run NVM commands:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ nvm install 0.10 # Install version 0.10
$ nvm use 0.10     # Use version 0.10</programlisting>
<simpara>There are many more commands available with NVM, all of which can be
found at the <link xl:href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">repository where the tool is hosted</link>.</simpara>

</indexterm><indexterm>
<primary>package.json</primary>
</indexterm>Much like Ruby has a Gemfile that indicates required libraries, so
too does NodeJS have an equivalent file. In NodeJS, this file is
called <emphasis>package.json</emphasis>.  To install all required libraries for any
project, use the <literal>npm</literal> tool (installed by default when you install
NodeJS using NVM). Running <literal>npm</literal> without any arguments will
install all libraries specified by the application if there is a
<emphasis>package.json</emphasis> file included with the project. If you want to add a
package to an existing <emphasis>package.json</emphasis> file, you can append <literal>--save</literal> to
the npm command and npm will update <emphasis>package.json</emphasis> for you once the
installation of the package has completed.</simpara>

</indexterm>When a process runs in the shell, it runs within an environment, and
this environment can be configured with key/value pairs. These are called
environment variables. A common reason for this is that you can write
a program that reads passwords from the environment variables and
then specify them at runtime rather than in the source code. You
specify environment variables either as key/value pairs joined by an
equal sign in front of a command, or by using the <literal>export</literal> command to
persist them across commands:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ PASSWORD=MyPwd123 myProgram  # myProgram retrieves the variable PASSWORD
$ export PASSWORD=MyPwd123
$ myProgram # PASSWORD is now a persisted key value</programlisting>

</indexterm>The shell invokes commands when you hit the Enter key. But there are
times when you want to break a command into multiple lines for
readability. In this case, break each line up using the backslash

<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ git log -S http
...
$ git \
log \

<simpara>Though not the most compelling command to break into multiple lines,
this example shows two commands that do exactly the same thing.</simpara>

</indexterm>Shell commands were written long ago in an era when programs fulfilled
upon a small set of functionality, in stark contrast to today&#8217;s
monolithic GUI programs. Each program generally did a few simple
things and then passed information to another program for further
processing. Programs then needed an elegant way to pass data between
each other, and the pipe was born. Pipes facilitate communication
between processes: one command&#8217;s output becomes another command&#8217;s
input.</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ cat /etc/mime.types | grep http
application/http
application/vnd.httphone
application/x-httpd-eruby     rhtml
application/x-httpd-php
phtml pht php
application/x-httpd-php-source      phps</programlisting>
<simpara>This invocation uses the cat program to output the file

program, which looks inside the input to find all lines that contain
the string http.</simpara>
