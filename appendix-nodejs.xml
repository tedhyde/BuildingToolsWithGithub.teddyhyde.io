<title>NodeJS</title>
<simpara>NodeJS has gained immense popularity in the last few years. JavaScript
is the language of client-side development on the web, and many people
are excited about developing in the same language on the server side. One of
the chapters in this book discusses Hubot, GitHub&#8217;s "devops" chatbot.
Hubot is written in NodeJS. Fortunately, installing NodeJS is simple
using NVM.</simpara>
<simpara>NVM stands for "Node Version Manager" and is a direct correlate
to RVM. To install it run these commands from a shell prompt:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ curl https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh</programlisting>

<title>package.json</title>
<simpara>Much like Ruby has a Gemfile which indicates required libraries, so
too does NodeJS have an equivalent file. In NodeJS, this file is
called <literal>package.json</literal>.  To install all required libraries for any
project, use the <literal>npm</literal> tool. Running without any arguments will
install all libraries specified by the application if there is a
<literal>package.json</literal> file included with the project.</simpara>
