# NodeJS

NodeJS has gained immense popularity in the last few years. JavaScript
is the language of client-side development on the web, and many people
are excited about developing in the same language on the server side.
One of the chapters in this book discusses Hubot, GitHubâ€™s "devops"
chatbot. Hubot is written in NodeJS. Fortunately, installing NodeJS is
simple using NVM.

NVM stands for "Node Version Manager" and is a direct correlate to RVM.
To install it run these commands from a shell prompt:

``` bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh
```

## package.json

Much like Ruby has a Gemfile which indicates required libraries, so too
does NodeJS have an equivalent file. In NodeJS, this file is called
`package.json`. To install all required libraries for any project, use
the `npm` tool. Running without any arguments will install all libraries
specified by the application if there is a `package.json` file included
with the project.
