<title>Preface</title>
<simpara>This book contains stories about building software tools.</simpara>
<simpara>If you write software on a daily basis, you realize the act of
writing software is the craft of creating tools. Software is nothing
more than a tool. A spreadsheet is fundamentally a tool to
add and subtract numbers. A video game is fundamentally a tool to
alleviate boredom. Almost immediately after people started writing
software tools we then discovered we needed more tools to permit us to
write the tools we set out to build in the first place. <indexterm>
<primary>meta&#8211;tools</primary>
</indexterm>Let&#8217;s
call these tools that are strictly to support writing software (rather
than software tools for the general population) meta-tools.</simpara>
<simpara>One of the most important meta-tools in the software development world
is Git. Git is a meta-tool that helps software developers
manage the complexity that comes from writing software. Git allows
software developers to store snapshots of their programs (and then
easily restore those snapshots if necessary) and to easily collaborate
with other programmers (a surprisingly complicated problem). <indexterm>
<primary>source code management (SCM)</primary>
</indexterm>Git is
called a source code management (SCM) tool and though there were many other
SCMs before Git, Git has taken the software world by storm like no
other before it and now dominates the SCM landscape.</simpara>
<simpara>GitHub is a company that saw the immense potential of Git early on and
built a layer of web services on top of the existing features found
in Git. Not surprisingly, one of the factors behind its success was that
GitHub employees embraced the ethos of writing meta-tools from the
beginning. Building meta-tools requires the courage to take a little
extra time to build a meta-tool rather than
taking the easy route to get the public-facing software out the
door. GitHub employees are proud of this prioritization and have
written extensively about the benefits, which include easy on-boarding
of new hires and a transparent workflow visible to all employees.</simpara>
<simpara>This book looks at the tools GitHub uses internally. The
GitHub.com website is itself a meta-tool, and we discuss the many
facets of the GitHub service. Specifically these technologies are the
GitHub API and related GitHub technologies, Gollum wiki, Jekyll
static  page generator, and the chat robot called Hubot (if you are
not familiar with any of these, we&#8217;ll explain them fully in their
respective chapters).</simpara>
<simpara>To reiterate, this book is not a reference of those technologies. This
book is a story-book, a book that relates the process of building
software meta-tools, explaining not only the technology specifics, but
also the compromises, the realities of refactoring, and the challenges
inherent to writing meta-tools in long narrative story
form.</simpara>
<simpara>Meta-tools require a different mindset than what comes from
building software available to the general population. Meta-tools are
generally open source, which requires a
different level of responsibility and usage. One could argue that
software engineers are more demanding of quality than general users
because software developers know they can take action to improve or
fork software that does not work for them. Meta-tools enforce a higher
level of contributory involvement, which makes automated tests
almost a requirement. All of these concepts constitute the background
story behind meta-tools, and we show you how they play out when
building your own.</simpara>

<title>Why APIs and Why the GitHub API?</title>
<simpara><indexterm>
<primary>APIs, reasons for using</primary>
</indexterm><indexterm>
<primary>GitHub API</primary><secondary>reasons for using</secondary>
</indexterm>
<indexterm>
<primary>reasons for using</primary>
</indexterm>Using an API to back an application is a common practice today: this
is the future of application development. APIs provide a great pattern
for making data accessible to the multiscreen world. If your
application is backed by a remote service API, the
first application could be a mobile app running on Apple&#8217;s iOS
operating system. Critically, if that business model does not turn out
to be correct, you can respond quickly to changing requirements and
iterate to build another application for an Android wearable. Or,
perhaps you&#8217;ll build an integrated car application, or any other
console (or even nonconsole) application. As long as your applications
can send and receive data using calls to a remote API you are free to
build whatever user interface you want on whatever platform you want.</simpara>
<simpara>As an author, you could write and host your own API. Many frameworks
for popular languages like Ruby, Go, or Java support building APIs
using standard architectural styles like REST. Or, you could use a
third-party API. In this book we&#8217;ll focus on a third-party API: the
GitHub API.</simpara>
<simpara>Why the GitHub API? The GitHub API is exceedingly relevant if you are
building software because you are probably using GitHub to manage your
software code. For those that aren&#8217;t, you might be using Git without
GitHub, and the GitHub API is useful to know there as well, as it
layers the functionality of Git into a networked programming interface.</simpara>
<simpara>The GitHub API is perhaps the best designed API I&#8217;ve ever used. <indexterm>
<primary>Hypermedia API</primary>
</indexterm>It is
a Hypermedia API, which is an arguably successful attempt to make
API clients resilient to API changes&#x2014;a tricky problem. The API is well
versioned. It is comprehensive, mapping closely to most features of
Git. It is consistent across sections and well organized. The GitHub
API is a great API on which to build applications, serving as a
case study for a well-designed API.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_structure_of_this_book">
<title>Structure of This Book</title>
<simpara>The GitHub API is extremely comprehensive, permitting access and
modification of almost all data and metadata stored or associated with
a Git repository. Here is a grouped summary of the sections of the API ordered
alphabetically as they are on the <link xl:href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API documentation site</link>:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Activity: notifications of interesting events in your developer life</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Gists: programmatically create and share code snippets</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Git Data: raw access to Git data over a remote API</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Issues: add and modify issues</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Miscellaneous: whatever does not fit into the general API
categorization</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Organizations: access and retrieve organizational membership data</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Pull Requests: a powerful API layer on the popular merge process</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>Repositories: modify everything and anything related to repositories</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Search: code-driven search within the entire GitHub database</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Users: access user data</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Enterprise: specifics about using the API when using the private
corporate GitHub</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In addition, though not a part of the API, there are other important
technologies you should know about when using GitHub that are not
covered in the API documentation:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Jekyll and "gh-pages": hosting blogs and static documentation</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Gollum: wikis tied to a repository</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Hubot: a programmable chat robot used extensively at GitHub</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Each of these sections of the GitHub technology stack are covered in
various chapters (with two exceptions, which we explain next). The GitHub API
documentation is a stellar reference you will use constantly
when writing any application that talks to the API, but the chapters
in this book serve a different purpose:
these chapters are stories about building applications on top of
the technologies provided by GitHub. Within these stories you will learn
the trade-offs and considerations you will face when you use the GitHub
API. Chapters in this book often cover multiple pieces of the API
when appropriate for the story we are telling. We&#8217;ve generally tried
to focus on a major API section and limit exposure to other pieces as
much as possible, but most chapters do need to bring in small pieces
of more than one section.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is a short synopsis of each chapter:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="introduction"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>  This chapter covers a
  first look at the API through the command-line HTTP client called
  cURL. We talk a bit about the response format and how to parse it
  within the command line, and also document authentication. This is
  the only chapter that does not build an application from the
  technologies presented.
<xref linkend="chapter2"/>: This chapter covers the Gist API, as well as command-line
  tools and the Ruby language "Octokit" API client. We then take this
  API and build a simple Ruby server that is stored as a gist and
  displays gists.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="chapter3"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>This chapter explains usage of the Gollum command-line tool
and associated Ruby library (gem), which is backed by Grit, the
C-language bindings for accessing Git repositories. We also
document some details of the Git storage format and how it applies
to storing large files inside of a Git repository, and show how to
use the Git command-line tools to play with this information. We use
Gollum and the Grit libraries to build an image management tool
that also functions as a regular Gollum wiki, which can be published
to GitHub.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="python_search_api"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>In this chapter we explore the Search API and build a GUI
tool to search repositories on GitHub using Python.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="commit_status"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>This chapter covers a relatively new part of
the API that documents the interactions between third-party tools
and your code. This chapter builds an application using C# and the
Nancy .NET GitHub API libraries.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="Jekyll"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you push a specifically organized
repository into GitHub, GitHub will host a fully featured blog,
equivalent in most ways to a Wordpress site (well, except for the
complexity part). This chapter documents how to format your
repository, how to use Markdown within Jekyll, how to use
programmatic looping constructs provided by Liquid Templates, and
then shows how to import an entire website from the Internet
Archive into the Jekyll format using Ruby. We show
how to respectfully spider a site using caching, a valuable
technique when using APIs or third-party public information.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="android_and_git_data_api"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>In this chapter we create a mobile
application targeting the Android OS. Our application reads and
writes information into a Jekyll repository from the Git Data
section of the API. We show how to create user interface tests for
Android that verify GitHub API responses using the Calabash UI
testing tool.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="Hubot"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Hubot is a JavaScript (NodeJS) chat robot
enabling technologists to go beyond developer operations ("DevOps")
to a new frontier called "ChatOps." This chapter illustrates
using the Activity and Pull Requests section
of the API. In addition, we show how you can simulate GitHub
notifications and how to write testable Hubot extensions (which is
often a challenge when writing JavaScript code). We string all these
pieces together and build a robot that automates assigning pull
request review requests.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><xref linkend="JavaScript"/></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Did you know you can host an entire
"single-page application" on GitHub? We show how you can build a
coffee shop information app backed by a flat file database hosted on
GitHub written in the JavaScript language. Importantly, we show how
you can write a testable JavaScript application that mocks out the
GitHub API when needed.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara><indexterm>
<primary>Organizations API</primary>
</indexterm>We don&#8217;t cover the Organizations API: this is a small facet of the API
with only the ability to list organizations and modify metadata about
your organization; once you have used other parts of the API this nook
of the API will be very intuitive.</simpara>
<simpara><indexterm>
<primary>Users API</primary>
</indexterm>We also don&#8217;t cover the Users section of the API. While you might
expect it to be an important part of the API, the Users API is really
nothing more than an endpoint to list information about users, add or
remove SSH keys, adjust email addresses, and modify your list of
followers.</simpara>
<simpara><indexterm>
<primary>issues</primary>
</indexterm>There is not a specific chapter on issues. GitHub originally
grouped issues and pull requests into the same API section, but with the
growing importance of pull requests GitHub has separated them in the
API documentation. In fact, they are still internally stored in the
same database and pull requests are, at least for now, just another
type of issue. <xref linkend="Hubot"/> documents using pull requests and
is a good reference for issues in that way.</simpara>
<simpara><indexterm>
<primary>GitHub Enterprise</primary><secondary>API</secondary>
</indexterm>
<indexterm>
<primary>API</primary>
</indexterm>The Enterprise API works almost exactly the same as the GitHub.com
site API. We don&#8217;t have a chapter telling a story about an Enterprise
version of the API, but we do provide an <link linkend="appendix">appendix</link> that contains a few
notes about how the examples work when using an Enterprise server. We also
provide the specific syntax for each of the languages used in the
chapters that will make any of the examples provided work with an
Enterprise server.</simpara>
<simpara>Through these stories about the technologies behind GitHub we hope to
give you an inside look at the inner workings of the brain of a
developer building on top of the GitHub API.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_who_you_are">
<title>Who You Are</title>
<simpara>This book should be an interesting source of information for people
who have used Git or GitHub and want to "level-up" their skills
related to these technologies. People without any experience using
GitHub or Git should start with an introductory book on these
technologies.</simpara>
<simpara>You should have good familiarity with at least one imperative modern
programming language. You don&#8217;t need to be an expert programmer to
read this book, but having some programming experience and familiarity
with at least one language is essential.</simpara>
<simpara>You should understand the basics of the HTTP protocol. The GitHub team
uses a very standard RESTful approach for its API. You should
understand the difference between a GET request and POST request and what
HTTP status codes mean at the very least.</simpara>
<simpara>Familiarity with other web APIs will make traversing these
chapters easier, although this book simultaneously aspires to provide
a guide showing how a well-thought-out, well-designed, and well-tested
web API creates a foundation for building fun and powerful tools. If
you have not used web APIs extensively, but have experience using
other types of APIs, you will be in good company.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_what_you_will_learn">
<title>What You Will Learn</title>
<simpara>Much of the book focuses on the technical capabilities exposed by
GitHub and the powerful GitHub API. Perhaps you feel constrained by
using Git only from within a certain toolset; for example, if you are
an Android developer using Git to manage your app source code and want
to unlock Git in other places in your life as a developer, this book
provides a wider vista to learn about the power of Git and GitHub. If
you have fallen into using Git for your own projects and are now
interested in using Git within a larger community, this book can teach
you all about the "social coding" style
pioneered and dogfooded by the GitHub team. This book provides a
stepping stone for software developers who have used other distributed
version control systems and are looking for a bridge to using their
skills with Git and within a web service like GitHub.</simpara>
<simpara>Like any seasoned developer, automation of your tools is important to
you. This book provides examples of mundane tasks converted into
automated and repeatable processes. We show how to do this using a
variety of languages talking to the GitHub API.</simpara>
<simpara>To make this book accessible to everyone, regardless of
their editor or operating system, many of the programming samples work
within the command line. If you are unfamiliar with the "command line"
this book will give you a firm understanding of how to use it, and we
bet you will find great power there. If you have hated the command
line since your father forced you to use it when you were five, this
is the perfect book to rekindle a loving relationship with the bash
shell.</simpara>
<simpara>If you absorb not only the technical facets of using GitHub but also
pay attention to the cultural and ideological changes offered behind
the tools, you&#8217;ll very likely see a new way of working in the modern
age. We focus on these "meta" viewpoints as we discuss the tools
themselves to help you see these extra opportunities.</simpara>
<simpara>Almost every chapter has an associated repository hosted on GitHub
where you can review the code discussed. Fork away and take these
samples into your own projects and tools!</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, we help you write testable API-backed code. Even the most experienced
developers often find that writing tests for their code is a
challenge, despite the massive body of literature connecting quality
code with tests. Testing can be especially challenging when you are
testing something backed by an API; it requires a different level of
thinking than is found in strict unit testing. To help you get past
this roadblock, whenever possible, this book shows you how to write
code that interacts with the GitHub API and is testable.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_github_first_class_languages">
<title>GitHub "First Class" Languages</title>
<simpara>There are two languages that are so fundamentally linked to GitHub
that you do need to install and use them in order to get the most out
of this book.</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><indexterm>
<primary>Ruby</primary>
</indexterm>Ruby</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>A simple, readable programming language the founders of
GitHub used extensively early in the life of the company.</simpara>

</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><indexterm>
<primary>JavaScript</primary>
</indexterm>JavaScript</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The only ubiquitous browser-side programming language; its
importance has grown to new heights with the introduction of
<indexterm>
<primary>NodeJS</primary>
</indexterm>NodeJS, rivaling even the popularity of Ruby on Rails as a server-side toolkit for web applications, especially for independent  developers.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>Undoubtedly, many of you picking up this book already have familiarity
with Ruby or JavaScript/NodeJS. So, the basics and installation of them are in
appendices in the back of the book. The appendices don&#8217;t cover syntax
of these languages; we expect you have experience with other languages
as a prerequisite and can read code from any imperative language
regardless of the syntax. Later chapters discuss facets of the API and
go into language details at times, but the code is readable regardless
of your familiarity with that particular language. These
explanatory appendices discuss the history of these tools within the
GitHub story as well as important usage notes like special files and
installation options.</simpara>
<simpara>Your time will not be wasted if you install and play with these two
tools. Between them you will have a solid toolset to begin
exploration of the GitHub API. Several chapters in this book use Ruby
or JavaScript, so putting in some time to learn at least a little bit will
make the journey through this book richer for you.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_who_this_book_is_not_for">
<title>Who This Book Is Not For</title>
<simpara>If you are looking for a discussion of the GitHub API that focuses on
a single language, you should know that we look at the API through
many different languages. We do this to describe the API from not only
the way the GitHub team designed it to work, but the aspirational way
that client library authors made it work within
diverse programming languages and communities. We think there is a lot
to learn from this approach, but if you are interested in only a
specific language and how it works with the GitHub API, this is not
the book for you.</simpara>
<simpara>This book strives to prove that API-driven code is testable and that
there is a benefit to doing so. This book does not intend to provide a
manual on how to write perfectly tested code. We cover too many
languages to end the healthy debates happening within each community
about the right test frameworks. Instead, given our contention that most
software projects have zero test coverage, this book tries to help
you get past this significant roadblock. There is something
transformational about writing tests if you have never done so
before. Having these examples in hand, we hope, will allow you to
transition to writing testable code for APIs, especially if you have
not done so before. Some of the associated repositories have much
greater test suites than are documented in this book, but we don&#8217;t
cover all the entire set of edge cases in every situation.</simpara>

<simpara>Chris wants to thank his lovely wife, Nicole. I hope that I have added
to this book even a tiny bit of the wit and wisdom you provide to me
and our family every day. My son Roosevelt&#8217;s energy continues to
inspire me and keep me going even when I am at my limits. To my
daughter Charlotte, you are my little smiling Buddha. To my mother,
who showed me how to write and, most importantly, why to write, which
is something we need more of in the technology world. To Tim O&#8217;Brien
who invited me into this project, thank you, and I hope we can
collaborate again. To Bradley Horowitz, who demonstrates how small
acts of kindness can have immeasurable impact. And, to David J. Groom,
though we have never met face to face, your suggestions and excitement
about the book early on came at a critical moment in the life of this
book, and I thank you for channeling the excitement I hoped to
cultivate with people who would one day pick up this book.<indexterm>

<simpara>Ben would like to thank his wife, Becky, for her ongoing support and
(when needed) push from behind. None of this would have happened
without you.<indexterm>
